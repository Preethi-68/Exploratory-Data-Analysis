# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims is to delve into global suicide rates data to uncover patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to suicide rates across different countries and demographics.
By leveraging statistical and data visualization techniques, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the data, identify key insights, and highlight areas that may warrant further investigation or intervention.

### Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis refer to the analysis of a single variable. The main purpose of univariate analysis is to summarize and find patterns in the data. The key point is that there is only one variable involved in the analysis.

Let us take the 'Melbourne Housing' dataset and work on that for the univariate analysis.

Import necessary libraries and Load Data
Univariate Data Analysis
Checking distribution of data - distplot, violin plot, histograms, commulative distributions
Multivariate Data Analysis
Encoding Categorical Variables - One-hot encoding and label encoding
Normalization and Scaling



### Bivariate Analysis

Through bivariate analysis we try to analyze two variables simultaneously. As opposed to univariate analysis where we check the characteristics of a single variable, in bivariate analysis we try to determine if there is any relationship between two variables.

 

There are essentially 3 major scenarios that we will come accross when we perform bivariate analysis

Both variables of interest are qualitative
One variable is qualitative and the other is quantitative
Both variables are quantitative
 

For the purpose of this Case study, we will explore few most popular techniques to perform bivariate analysis.

The following plots are not limited to the headings they are under. They are the options we have if we face a certain scenario.
