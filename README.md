# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims is to delve into global suicide rates data to uncover patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to suicide rates across different countries and demographics.
By leveraging statistical and data visualization techniques, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the data, identify key insights, and highlight areas that may warrant further investigation or intervention.


### Bivariate Analysis

Through bivariate analysis we try to analyze two variables simultaneously. As opposed to univariate analysis where we check the characteristics of a single variable, in bivariate analysis we try to determine if there is any relationship between two variables.

 

There are essentially 3 major scenarios that we will come accross when we perform bivariate analysis

Both variables of interest are qualitative
One variable is qualitative and the other is quantitative
Both variables are quantitative
 

For the purpose of this Case study, we will explore few most popular techniques to perform bivariate analysis.

The following plots are not limited to the headings they are under. They are the options we have if we face a certain scenario.
